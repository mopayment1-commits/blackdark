## Statement

BLACKDARK declares **engineering closure** for the Launch-57 CISA Secure by Demand remediation track in this repository: policies, controls, tests, evidence index, CI workflows, and operator runbooks are implemented per `CISA_REMEDIATION_EVIDENCE_INDEX.json`.

This is **not** whole-program closure and **not** CISA certification.
